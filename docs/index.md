# [](#about-project)About This Project

## Motivation

I originally started this project as a means to learn about building my own [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA).

## Goals

* Create a PWA that allow users to manage code deployments regardless of network connection

## Why Vue.js

About several weeks before I started working on this project I was introduced by [John Rocela](https://github.com/jmrocela) to [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). Vue.js also comes along with 2 additional plugins, [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) and [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/), which are similar to [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) and [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) packages that I was already using in my personal and work [React JS](https://github.com/reactjs) projects, so out of curiousity I decided to try it out.
